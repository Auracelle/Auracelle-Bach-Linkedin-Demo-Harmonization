Named after the composer Johann Sebastian Bach, this system harmonizes multiple governance frameworks into coherent policy insights.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Stakeholder Harmonization**: Integrates perspectives from academia, civil society, and research institutions
- **Evidence-Based Policy Analysis**: Combines theoretical frameworks with real-world governance scenarios
- **Interactive Simulations**: Explores policy outcomes across different governance approaches
- **Academic Rigor**: Built on the Evans AGPO (Accelerated Governance Policy Optimization) Framework

## Target Audience

- Academic researchers in AI governance
- Civil society organizations
- Policy think tanks
- Graduate students and PhD candidates
- Research institutions

## Technology Stack

This is a single-page web application built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3 with custom animations
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive design for all devices

## About E-AGPO-HT Framework

Auracelle Bach is powered by the proprietary E-AGPO-HT (Evans Accelerated Governance Policy Optimization - Hierarchical Theory), a three-stratum wargaming intelligence framework:

- **Stratum III**: g-GWC (General Governance Wargaming Capacity)
- **Stratum II**: 7 Broad Governance Capabilities + 4 AI acceleration factors
- **Stratum I**: ~40 Narrow Operational Factors

## Research Context

Developed by Grace Evans, Director and Principal Investigator at Auracelle AI Governance Labs, as part of PhD research in AI Governance Policy Optimization at Bath Spa University.
